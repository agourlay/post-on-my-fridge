#post-on-my-fridge  

Just sticky notes shared in real time on virtual fridges.

This application focuses on realtime interactions and simplicity. 

The backend is written in Scala using [Akka](http://akka.io/) actor's model and [Spray](http://spray.io/) for the rest/http interface. 

The frontend is a single page web app written in javascript with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).

![alt text](./misc/screenshot.png "Overview")

## Architecture

A single page web app displays the content of a fridge and subscribes to all the notifications occuring on it.

When an action, such as creating or moving a post is called on a fridge, a notification enclosing the new state is pushed via Server Sent Event to all the current fridgeÂ´s clients. 

This architecture allows near real time collaboration on a fridge.

## Setup

This is full-stack application, you need SBT to build it and a postgreSQL instance to run it.

The frontend is also embedded into the spray application in the [frontend](https://github.com/agourlay/post-on-my-fridge/blob/master/src/main/resources/frontend) folder. It uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for javascript build management.

The easiest way to deploy the project on a server is to build and run a fatjar.

```sh
sbt assembly
java -jar pomf-api.jar &
```
I have provided my nginx configuration in the [misc](https://github.com/agourlay/post-on-my-fridge/blob/master/misc/nginx.conf) folder, it assumes that the application runs on 127.0.0.1:8080
