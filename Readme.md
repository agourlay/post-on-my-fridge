### Architecture

A single page web app built with Ember.js displays the content of a fridge and subscribes to notifications for the current fridge.

The backend is a non blocking rest API that reads and modifies fridges. It is built with Spray.io and Slick for persistence. When an action such as creating or moving a post is called on a fridge, a notification about the new state is sent via Server Sent Event to all the current fridgeÂ´s clients. 

This technique allows near real time collaboration on a fridge.
